I am a PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the 
[School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/research/index.php)
of the  
[University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in Scotland.
Currently I am working at the [Centre for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) at the Flatiron Institute in New York as a pre-doctoral fellow.
I am also a member of  an interdisciplinary 
[Centre for Exoplanet Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/exoplanets/index.html)
at St Andrews.

My broad research interests are how in building probabilistic models for astrophysical data.
Specifically, my thesis is on building models of
[gravitational microlensing](http://microlensing-source.org/concept/) 
events, a particular method of detecting 
[exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet).
At the Centre for Computational Astrophysics in  New York I am working on a method for inferring time-dependent maps of the surfaces of volcanic exoplanets.

Previously, I studied the interaction between evolving stars and the 
dynamics of exoplanets at [Lund Observatory](http://www.astro.lu.se/) 
in Sweden, working with [Alex Mustill](http://www.astro.lu.se/~alex/). 
These days I am mostly interested in statistical modeling in 
general, and Bayesian models in particular, with the goal of using these
methods to understand properties of the great variety of exoplanets we have
observed so far. 
You can read more about my current and past research 
[here](https://fbartolic.github.io/research/).

I was born and raised in sunny Croatia where I did my undergraduate and masters degree in physics.
Other than astronomy, I am interested in all things related to [complexity science](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/), reading, cooking, listening to [podcasts](https://www.jimruttshow.com/) and a bunch of other things.
