I am a PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the School of Physics and Astronomy at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) which is located in a small Scottish seaside town of St Andrews.
I am also a member of the interdisciplinary [Centre for Exoplanet Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/exoplanets/index.html) at St Andrews.

My research interests revolve around building Bayesian probabilistic models for astrophysical time series data.
The main focus of my research is [gravitational microlensing](http://microlensing-source.org/concept/), a particular method for detecting and characterizing [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet) and Black Holes. 

In addition to microlensing, in collaboration with researchers from the [Centre for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) in New York I am working on mapping the surfaces of planets and moons from one-dimensional time series brightness measurements. 
In the short term, this work will enable us to map volcanic activity on so called [lava planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_planet) with NASA's upcoming [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/).
In the [long term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Ultraviolet_Optical_Infrared_Surveyor), it will enable astronomers to *map the surfaces of Earth size (and potentially Earth like) planets orbiting distant stars*! 
Before starting my PhD, I worked on the interaction between evolving stars and the 
dynamics of exoplanets at [Lund Observatory](http://www.astro.lu.se/) 
in Sweden. 
You can read more about my current and past research 
[here](https://fbartolic.github.io/research/).

I was born and raised in sunny Croatia where I finished an undergraduate and masters degree in physics.
Other than astronomy statistics and machine learning, I am interested in all things related to [complexity science](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/), reading, cooking, listening to [podcasts](https://www.jimruttshow.com/) and a bunch of other things.
