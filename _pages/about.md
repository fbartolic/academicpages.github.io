I am a PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/research/index.php) at the
[University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in Scotland.
I am a part of [ScotDIST](https://www.scotdist.ac.uk/about-us), a 
partnership between several Scottish universities which offers PhD studentships 
in Data-Intensive science, focusing on areas such as machine
learning, big data, and high-performance computing. I am also a member of 
an interdisciplinary [Centre for Exoplanet Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/exoplanets/index.html)
at St Andrews.
In my work, I focus on modeling 
[gravitational microlensing](http://microlensing-source.org/concept/) events, a particular method
of detecting [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), 
using advanced statistical methods.

Previously, I studied the interaction between evolving stars and the 
dynamics of exoplanets at [Lund Observatory](http://www.astro.lu.se/) 
in Sweden, working with [Alex Mustill](http://www.astro.lu.se/~alex/). Now I am 
mostly interested in statical modeling in 
general, and Bayesian models in particular, with the goal of using these
methods to understand properties of the great variety of exoplanets we have
observed so far. You can read more about my current and past research 
[here](https://fbartolic.github.io/research/).

I was born and raised in sunny Croatia, I did my undergraduate degree in 
physics at the University of Split, and my master's degree at 
the University of Rijeka. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, reading, 
dancing Argentine Tango, 
[photography](https://fbartolic.github.io/research/), listening
to podcasts, and cooking.
